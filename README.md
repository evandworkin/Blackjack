The game of Blackjack, coded in Java. Includes GUI made with Swing.

The game is inteded to be run from Main. It is currently set up
for a table with 2 players, one with a bankroll of $100 and the
other with a bankroll of $200. These numbers are arbitrary, but
as of 10/14/2024 must be updated before compile time by changing
their values in Main.
I am currently working on an interface for the players and their
bankrolls to be input during runtime
